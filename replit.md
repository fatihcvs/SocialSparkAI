## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built using modern React 18 with TypeScript, utilizing Vite as the build tool for optimized development and production builds. The UI framework leverages TailwindCSS for styling combined with shadcn/ui components for a consistent design system. Form management is handled through React Hook Form with Zod validation, while state management and server communication uses TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient data fetching and caching.

### Backend Architecture
The server-side implementation uses Node.js with Express.js framework, written entirely in TypeScript for type safety. The application follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation between routes, controllers, middleware, and services. The API implements RESTful endpoints with comprehensive error handling and validation.

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Replit native database) for production-ready database operations. The database includes 7 tables: users, social_accounts, content_ideas, post_assets, subscriptions, api_usage, and sessions. The schema supports multi-tenancy, JWT authentication sessions, and includes proper indexing for performance optimization. Database migration handled via `npm run db:push`.

### Authentication and Authorization
Security is implemented through JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing. The system includes comprehensive middleware for token validation, rate limiting (both user-based and IP-based), and plan-based feature access control. Additional security measures include Helmet for HTTP headers, CORS configuration, and Express rate limiting.

### Content Generation Services
AI-powered content generation is handled through OpenAI's APIs, specifically using GPT-4o for text generation and DALL-E 3 for image creation. The system includes intelligent prompting strategies tailored for different social media platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok) with customizable tone and target audience parameters.

### Social Media Integration
Primary integration through Zapier webhooks (Pro feature). Users configure Zapier automations to connect with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and other platforms. When ZAPIER_HOOK_URL is configured, the system sends posts to Zapier webhook endpoints for flexible social media automation. Buffer API integration was cancelled in favor of Zapier's more flexible approach.

### Payment Processing
Subscription management planned for ƒ∞yzico integration with support for recurring subscriptions (monthly unlimited post access). Currently using Stripe for development/testing. The system handles webhook events for subscription status updates and includes proper plan-based feature gating.
